# Farewise
FareWise is a smart travel website that helps users find the cheapest and safest way to commute. It compares cab fares, suggests walk-to-save pickup points, and locates nearby metro stations and bus stops. With real-time route guidance and fare estimates, it makes urban travel affordable and easy.
Problem Statement
In urban areas, commuters often face challenges such as overpriced cab and auto fares, lack of transparency in pricing, and difficulty in finding the most economical travel option. Many passengers, especially students, tourists, and newcomers, are unaware that walking a short distance to a better pickup point or choosing nearby public transport like buses or metro can significantly reduce travel costs. Currently, there is no single platform that provides real-time fare comparison, optimized pickup suggestions, and guidance to the cheapest and safest transport mode in one place. Therefore, there is a need for a smart solution like FareWise to make city travel more affordable, efficient, and transparent.

Solution
To address the problem of overcharging and lack of affordable travel guidance, we developed FareWise, a smart travel companion platform that helps users choose the most economical and efficient mode of transport. FareWise compares estimated fares across multiple travel options such as cabs, autos, buses, and metro. It also suggests cost-saving pickup points by recommending short walking distances to nearby locations with cheaper fares. Additionally, it locates the nearest bus stops and metro stations, enabling users to shift toward public transport when it is more affordable. Overall, FareWise ensures transparent pricing, better route planning, and safer commuting.
